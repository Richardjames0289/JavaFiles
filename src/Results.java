//	A person takes 3 exams in college, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, each 
//	exam has a maximum of 150 marks. When all the exam marks have been added together, 
//	we can find the overall percentage that the person has got by multiplying their score 
//	by 100 and then dividing by 450.
//
//	Create the results class, this class has 5 variables, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, 
//	total and percentage. This class should also have 2 methods:
//
//	Method 1 - displays the results that the person got for each exam and then the total mark. 
//	Try to make the output neat and bespoke for each exam.
//	Method 2 - which finds and displays the percentage that the person received for the exams overall.
