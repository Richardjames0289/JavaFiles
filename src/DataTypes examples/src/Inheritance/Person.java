package Inheritance;
//    - Every person should have some generic attributes (e.g. name, age) and functionality (e.g. eat, sleep).
//    - The Banker and Farmer subclasses should also have attributes and functionality unique to them.
//    - The two subclasses should have their own custom constructors to set any relevant values.
//    - The two subclasses should also override a method from the Person class and implement it differently.
//    - All three classes should override the toString() method in order to print some useful information about the class.
//    - The Subclass toString() methods should include the same information as Person, but with their own unqiue info on top.
//    - Use encapsulation - private class variables with getters & setters.
//    - Use a separate runner class with a main method.
